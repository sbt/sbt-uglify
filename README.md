[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt-uglify.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt-uglify) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/sbt-web/sbt-plugin-releases/sbt-uglify/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/sbt-web/sbt-plugin-releases/sbt-uglify/_latestVersion)

An sbt-web plugin to perform [UglifyJS optimization](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) on the asset pipeline.

Usage
-----
To use this plugin, use the addSbtPlugin command within your project's `plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-uglify" % "2.0.0")
```

Your project's build file also needs to enable sbt-web plugins. For example, with build.sbt:

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(SbtWeb)
```

As with all sbt-web asset pipeline plugins you must declare their order of execution:

```scala
pipelineStages := Seq(uglify)
```

A standard build profile for the Uglify optimizer is provided which will mangle variables for obfuscation and
compression. Each input `.js` file found in your assets folders will have a corresponding `.min.js` file and source maps will also be generated.

## includeFilter

If you wish to limit or extend what is uglified then you can use filters:
```scala
includeFilter in uglify := GlobFilter("myjs/*.js"),
```
...where the above will include only those files under the `myjs` folder.

The sbt `excludeFilter` is also available to the `uglify` scope and defaults to excluding the public folder and extracted Webjars.

## uglifyOps

If you wish to change how files are mapped from input to output, you can change the `uglifyOps` setting to point at another grouping.

The default ops takes a source file and produces minified file and source map:
```scala
uglifyOps := UglifyOps.singleFileWithSourceMapOut
```

This ops takes a source file and produces minified file only (no source map):
```scala
uglifyOps := UglifyOps.singleFile
```

This ops takes a source file and source map and produces minified file and combined source map. Your includeFilter must include source map files for this to work:
```scala
uglifyOps := UglifyOps.singleFileWithSourceMapInAndOut
```

## Settings
You are able to use and/or customize settings already made, and add your own. Here are a list of relevant settings and
their meanings (please refer to the [UglifyJS documentation](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) for details on the
options):
